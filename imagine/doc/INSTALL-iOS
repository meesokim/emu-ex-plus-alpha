The following sections supplement the ones in the main INSTALL text for the iOS port. An ARMv7 device running at least iOS 5.0 is required to run Imagine. However, it's possible to use an ARMv6 device with at least iOS 4.0 using the sysroot from Xcode 4.4 and some extra toolchain modifications, to be detailed in a future version of this document.

1. Tools and Environment Setup
==============================

The following make variables are used by the build system:

XCODE_PATH : Optional, defaults to $(shell xcode-select --print-path)
 - The path in the Xcode app bundle containing the "Platforms/" subdirectory
 
IOS_SDK : Optional, if not set the first SDK directory found is used
 - The version of the SDK in Xcode to use as the sysroot

ios_arch : Optional, default set by app
 - When building an Imagine-based app, specifies a space separated list of which architectures to build ("armv7 arm64" for example)
