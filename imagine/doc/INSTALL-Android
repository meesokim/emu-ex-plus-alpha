The following sections supplement the ones in the main INSTALL text for the Android port. A device running at least Android 2.3 is required to run Imagine.

1. Tools and Environment Setup
==============================

Download & install the Android SDK Manager

Download & extract Android NDK Revision 15 from https://github.com/android-ndk/ndk/wiki. Perform any one of the following to tell the build system the location of the NDK directory:

1. Add the root NDK directory to your PATH environment as instructed in Google's docs
2. Link or rename the root NDK directory to $(HOME)/android-ndk
3. Define ANDROID_NDK_PATH as shown below to use a custom location.

If using MacOS X, install the gmake package from MacPorts and use it instead of the regular make command when building.

The following make variables are used by the build system:

ANDROID_NDK_PATH : Optional, defaults to $(HOME)/android-ndk
 - The Android NDK root path containing the "platforms", "toolchains", & "sources" subdirectories

android_arch : Optional, default set by app
 - When building an Imagine-based app, specifies a space separated list of which architectures to build ("arm64 armv7 x86" for example)

2. Dependencies
===============

Install the SDK platform for Android 6.0 (API 23) and the Android Support Library v4 from the SDK Manager

3. Building
===========

In addition to the native library, build & install the Java portion of Imagine (imagine-v9.jar) using:

make -f android-java.mk install

To specify the SDK build tools version used for compiling the Java portion, set ANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties. For example:

ANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION=24.0.1
